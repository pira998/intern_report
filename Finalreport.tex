\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{cicd.png}
\caption{CI/CD}
\end{figure}

The automated process consists of several steps. First, the code is built and tested against the unit tests and integration tests to ensure that the code is working correctly. If the tests pass, the code is packaged and deployed to production. After the deployment, a series of end-to-end tests are run to ensure that the code is functioning correctly in the production environment.

Finally, after the code is tested and deployed, the changes are monitored. This includes tracking errors, performance metrics, and user feedback. If any issues are found, they are addressed and fixed as soon as possible.

CI/CD helps to ensure that the code is production-ready and that it works as expected. This helps to reduce the time and cost of development, as well as increase the quality of the product. It also helps to ensure that the code is always up-to-date and that any changes are tested and deployed quickly.

\subsubsection*{Alternative Credit Scoring (With Graph Analytics)}

Alternative credit scoring is a new approach to assessing the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. It uses the analysis of large amounts of data to develop a more accurate assessment and to provide a more accurate representation of a person's financial standing. This is done by analyzing a range of data sources, such as social media accounts, online behavior, and other sources of public data. Graph analytics is used to create a visualization of the data, which can then be used to assess the borrower's creditworthiness.

Graph analytics uses the connections between different data points to build a visual representation of the data. This visual representation can help to identify patterns and relationships that are not apparent in the data itself. For example, the connections between different accounts, such as a person's social media accounts, bank accounts, and credit cards, can be used to identify patterns in their spending and repayment habits. By aggregating this data, lenders can create a more comprehensive assessment of a borrower's creditworthiness.

Graph analytics can also be used to identify potential risks that may be associated with a borrower. For example, by analyzing the connections between a borrower and their friends, family, and business associates, lenders can identify possible links to fraudulent activity. This type of analysis can be used to identify potential risks that may not have been identified by traditional credit scoring methods.

By combining the analysis of large amounts of data with graph analytics, lenders can create a more accurate and comprehensive assessment of a borrower's creditworthiness. This can help to reduce the risk of fraud, while also providing lenders with a more accurate representation of a borrower's financial standing. This type of analysis can help to improve the accuracy of credit scoring and can provide lenders with a more reliable way to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers.

\section{Suggessions for Traning Establishment}
I suggest H2O.AI focus on introducing new features and tools to make the user experience more efficient. This could include developing a more user-friendly interface for applications, introducing automation to simplify data exploration and analysis, and providing better documentation and tutorials for those new to the platform. Additionally, H2O.AI could look into introducing AI-based algorithms and methods to improve the accuracy and speed of data analysis. Finally, I suggest H2O.AI works on improving the scalability of the platform, allowing businesses to take advantage of large datasets to gain insights quickly and efficiently.
